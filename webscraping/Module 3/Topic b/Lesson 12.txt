Lesson 12:  The Graph of the Equation 



Classwork

In Module 1, you graphed equations such as  by plotting the points on the Cartesian coordinate plane that corresponded to all of the ordered pairs of numbers  that were in the solution set.  We called the geometric figure that resulted from plotting those points in the plane the graph of the equation in two variables.

In this lesson, we extend this notion of the graph of an equation to the graph of  for a function .  In doing so, we use computer thought code to describe the process of generating the ordered pairs in the graph of .



Example 1

In the previous lesson, we studied a simple type of instruction that computers perform called a for-next loop.  Another simple type of instruction is an if-then statement.  Below is example code of a program that tests for and prints “True” when ; otherwise it prints “False.”

	Declare  integer
For all  from 1 to 4
	If  then
	 	Print True
	   else
		Print False
	End if
Next 

The output of this program code is

False
True
False
False



Notice that the if-then statement in the code above is really just testing whether each number in the loop is in the solution set.  








Example 2

Perform the instructions in the following programming code as if you were a computer and your paper were the computer screen. 

	Declare  integer
Initialize  as {}
For all  from 0 to 4
	If  then
	 	Append  to 
	   else
		Do NOT append  to 
	End if
Next 
Print 


Output:  









Discussion

Compare the for-next/if-then code above to the following set-builder notation we used to describe solution sets in Module 1:



Check to see that the set-builder notation also generates the set .  Whenever you see set-builder notation to describe a set, a powerful way to interpret that notation is to think of the set as being generated by a program like the for-next or if-then code above.










Exploratory Challenge 1

Next we write code that generates a graph of a two-variable equation  for  in  
and  in .  The solution set of this equation is generated by testing each ordered pair  in the set,



to see if it is a solution to the equation.  Then the graph is just the plot of solutions in the Cartesian plane.  We can instruct a computer to find these points and plot them using the following program.



			Declare  and  integers
Initialize  as {}
For all  in 
	For all  in 
		If  then
		 	Append  to 
	  	   else
			Do NOT append  to 
		End if
	Next 
Next 
Print 
Plot 

			

				



				
				Loops through each  for

is a solution.		and so on (see arrows in
				table below).

									





Use the table below to record the decisions a computer would make when following the program instructions above.  Fill in each cell with “Yes” or “No” depending on whether the ordered pair  would be appended or not.  (The step where  has been done for you.)

	

















No











Yes











No













What would be the output to the Print  command?  (The first ordered pair is listed for you.)

Output:
{           , __________, __________, __________, __________ }

	




Plot the solution set  in the Cartesian plane.  (The first ordered pair in  has been plotted for you.)









Exploratory Challenge 2

The program code in Exercise 3 is a way to imagine how set-builder notation generates solution sets and figures in the plane.  Given a function  with domain and range all real numbers, a slight modification of the program code above can be used to generate the graph of the equation : 



Even though the code below cannot be run on a computer, students can run the following thought code in their minds.

			Declare  and  real
Let 
Initialize  as {}
For all  in the real numbers
	For all  in the real numbers
		If  then
		 	Append  to 
	  	   else
			Do NOT append  to 
		End if
	Next 
Next 
Plot

Plot  on the Cartesian plane (the figure drawn is called the graph of ).

    





Describe how the thought code is similar to the set-builder notation .















A relative maximum for the function  occurs at the -coordinate of .  Substitute this point into the equation  to check that it is a solution to , and then plot the point on your graph.













A relative minimum for the function  occurs at the -coordinate of .  A similar calculation as you did above shows that this point is also a solution to .  Plot this point on your graph.











Look at your graph.  On what interval(s) is the function  decreasing?  



















Look at your graph.  On what interval(s) is the function  increasing? 



























Lesson Summary

Graph of :  Given a function  whose domain , and the range are subsets of the real numbers, the graph of  is the set of ordered pairs  in the Cartesian plane given by





When we write  for the graph of , it is understood that the domain is the largest set of real numbers for which the function  is defined.



The graph of  is the same as the graph of the equation .


Increasing/Decreasing:  Given a function  whose domain and range are subsets of the real numbers, 
and  is an interval contained within the domain, the function is called increasing on the interval if

 whenever  in .



It is called decreasing on the interval  if

 whenever  in .
