Function:  A function is a correspondence between two sets,  and , in which each element of  is matched to one and only one element of .  The set  is called the domain of the function.

The notation  is used to name the function and describes both  and .  If  is an element in the domain  of 
a function , then  is matched to an element of  called .  We say  is the value in  that denotes the output or image of  corresponding to the input .

The range (or image) of a function  is the subset of , denoted , defined by the following property:   is 
an element of  if and only if there is an  in  such that .



Example 1

Define the Opening Exercise using function notation.  State the domain and the range. 

















Example 2

Is the assignment of students to English teachers an example of a function?  If yes, define it using function notation, and state the domain and the range.











Example 3

Let  and .   and  are defined below.

				

		



Is  a function?  If yes, what is the domain, and what is the range?  If no, explain why  is not a function.









Is  a function?  If yes, what is the domain and range?  If no, explain why  is not a function.









What is )?  









If , then what might  be?








Exercises

Define to assign each student at your school a unique ID number.



Assign each student a unique ID number.

Is this an example of a function?  Use the definition to explain why or why not.









Suppose .  What does that mean?









Write your name and student ID number using function notation.























Let assign each student at your school to a grade level.

Is this an example of a function?  Explain your reasoning.



















Express this relationship using function notation, and state the domain and the range.



Assign each student to a grade level.





























Let  be the function that assigns each student ID number to a grade level.



Assign each student ID number to the student’s current grade level.

Describe the domain and range of this function.















Record several ordered pairs  that represent yourself and students in your group or class.















Jonny says, “This is not a function because every ninth grader is assigned the same range value of .  The range only has  numbers , but the domain has a number for every student in our school.”  Explain to Jonny why he is incorrect. 


















Problem Set 



Which of the following are examples of a function?  Justify your answers.

The assignment of the members of a football team to jersey numbers.

The assignment of U.S. citizens to Social Security numbers.

The assignment of students to locker numbers.

The assignment of the residents of a house to the street addresses.

The assignment of zip codes to residences.

The assignment of residences to zip codes.

The assignment of teachers to students enrolled in each of their classes.

The assignment of all real numbers to the next integer equal to or greater than the number.

The assignment of each rational number to the product of its numerator and denominator.



Sequences are functions.  The domain is the set of all term numbers (which is usually the positive integers), and the range is the set of terms of the sequence.  For example, the sequence , , , , , , … of perfect squares is the function:



Assign each term number to the square of that number. 

What is ?  What does it mean?

What is the solution to the equation ?  What is the meaning of this solution?

According to this definition, is  in the domain of ?  Explain why or why not.

According to this definition, is  in the range of?  Explain why or why not.



Write each sequence as a function.





, , where  is a positive integer greater than or equal to .
