FUNCTION:								DIAGRAM:

Let  such that .



SEQUENCE:

Let  for  where  is an integer.
















Exercise 1

Let .  Complete the following table using the definition of . 



Assign each  in  to the expression .































What are , , , , , and ?









What is the range of ? 









Exercise 2

The squaring function is defined as follows:

Let  be the function such that , where  is the set of all real numbers.

What are , , , , , , , and ?









What is the range of ?









What subset of the real numbers could be used as the domain of the squaring function to create a range with the same output values as the sequence of square numbers  from Lesson 9?















Exercise 3

Recall that an equation can either be true or false.  Using the function defined by  such that , determine whether the equation  is true or false for each in the domain of .



Is the equation 

true or false?

Justification



True

Substitute 0 into the equation.





The  on the left side comes from the definition of , and the value of  is also 1, so the equation is true.






















































If the domain of  were extended to all real numbers, would the equation still be true for each  in the domain of ?  Explain your thinking.











Exercise 4 

Write three different polynomial functions such that .



















Exercise 5

The domain and range of this function are not specified.  Evaluate the function for several values of .  What subset of the real numbers would represent the domain of this function?  What subset of the real numbers would represent its range?

Let 

















Lesson Summary

Algebraic Function:  Given an algebraic expression in one variable, an algebraic function is a function  such that for each real number  in the domain ,  is the value found by substituting the number  into all instances of the variable symbol in the algebraic expression and evaluating.  



The following notation will be used to define functions going forward.  If a domain is not specified, it is assumed to be the set of all real numbers.

For the squaring function, we say			Let .

For the exponential function with base , we say  	Let .



When the domain is limited by the expression or the situation to be a subset of the real numbers, it must be specified when the function is defined.

For the square root function, we say		Let  for .

To define the first  triangular numbers, we say	Let  for  where  is an integer.

Depending on the context, one either views the statement “ ” as part of defining the function  or as an equation that is true for all  in the domain of  or as a formula.
