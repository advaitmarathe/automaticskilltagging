Lesson Summary

Simple interest:  Interest is calculated once per year on the original amount borrowed or invested.  The interest does not become part of the amount borrowed or owed (the principal).

Compound interest:  Interest is calculated once per period on the current amount borrowed or invested.  Each period, the interest becomes a part of the principal.
