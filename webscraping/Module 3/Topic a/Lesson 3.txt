Lesson 3:  Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences



Classwork 

Exercise 2

Think of a real-world example of an arithmetic or a geometric sequence.  Describe it, and write its formula.



























Exercise 3

If we fold a rectangular piece of paper in half multiple times and count the number of rectangles created, what type of sequence are we creating?  Can you write the formula?










Lesson Summary

Two types of sequences were studied:

Arithmetic sequence:  A sequence is called arithmetic if there is a real number  such that each term in the sequence is the sum of the previous term and . 

Geometric sequence:  A sequence is called geometric if there is a real number  such that each term in the sequence is a product of the previous term and .
