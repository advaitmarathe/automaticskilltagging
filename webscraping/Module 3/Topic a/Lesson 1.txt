Lesson 1:  Integer Sequences—Should You Believe in Patterns? 



Classwork 

Opening Exercise

Mrs. Rosenblatt gave her students what she thought was a very simple task:

What is the next number in the sequence , , , , …?

Cody:  I am thinking of a plus  pattern, so it continues , , , , ….

Ali:  I am thinking of a repeating pattern, so it continues , , , , , , , , ….

Suri:  I am thinking of the units digits in the multiples of two, so it continues , , , , , , , , , ….

Are each of these valid responses?  





What is the hundredth number in the sequence in Cody’s scenario?  Ali’s?  Suri’s?





What is an expression in terms of  for the th number in the sequence in Cody’s scenario? 





Example 1

Jerry has thought of a pattern that shows powers of two.  Here are the first six numbers of Jerry’s sequence:

, , ,,,, ….

Write an expression for the th number of Jerry’s sequence.









  











Example 2

Consider the sequence that follows a plus  pattern:  ,,,, , ….

Write a formula for the sequence using both the  notation and the  notation.









Does the formula  generate the same sequence?  Why might some people prefer this formula?









Graph the terms of the sequence as ordered pairs  on the coordinate plane.  What do you notice about the graph?











Exercises 

Refer back to the sequence from the Opening Exercise.  When Mrs. Rosenblatt was asked for the next number in the sequence ,,,, …, she said .”  The class responded, “?”  

Yes, using the formula, .

Does her formula actually produce the numbers , , , and ?







What is the th term in Mrs. Rosenblatt’s sequence?







Consider a sequence that follows a minus  pattern:  ,,,, ….

Write a formula for the th term of the sequence.  Be sure to specify what value of  your formula starts with.







Using the formula, find the th term of the sequence.





Graph the terms of the sequence as ordered pairs  on a coordinate plane.  	



Consider a sequence that follows a times  pattern:   ,,, ….

Write a formula for the th term of the sequence.  Be sure to specify what value of  your formula starts with.









Using the formula, find the th term of the sequence.









Graph the terms of the sequence as ordered pairs  on a coordinate plane. 











Consider the sequence formed by the square numbers:



Write a formula for the th term of the sequence.  Be sure to specify what value of  your formula starts with.







Using the formula, find the th term of the sequence.







Graph the terms of the sequence as ordered pairs  on a coordinate plane.  

			





A standard letter-sized piece of paper has a length and width of  inches by  inches.

Find the area of one piece of paper.			









If the paper were folded completely in half, what would be the area of the resulting rectangle?









Write a formula for a sequence to determine the area of the paper after  folds.









What would the area be after  folds? 






Lesson Summary

Think of a sequence as an ordered list of elements.  Give an explicit formula to define the pattern of the sequence.  Unless specified otherwise, find the first term by substituting  into the formula.

Problem Set 



Consider a sequence generated by the formula  starting with .  Generate the terms , ,, , and .



Consider a sequence given by the formula starting with .  Generate the first  terms of the sequence.



Consider a sequence given by the formula starting with .  Generate the first  terms of the sequence.



Here is the classic puzzle that shows that patterns need not hold true.  What are the numbers counting? 



Based on the sequence of numbers, predict the next number.

Write a formula based on the perceived pattern.

Find the next number in the sequence by actually counting.

Based on your answer from part (c), is your model from part (b) effective for this puzzle?





For each of the sequences in Problems 5–8: 

Write a formula for the th term of the sequence.  Be sure to specify what value of  your formula starts with.

Using the formula, find the th term of the sequence.

Graph the terms of the sequence as ordered pairs  on a coordinate plane.  



The sequence follows a plus  pattern:   ….



The sequence follows a times  pattern:   ….



The sequence follows a times  pattern:  ….



The sequence follows a minus  pattern:   ….
