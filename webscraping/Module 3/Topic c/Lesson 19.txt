Lesson 19:  Four Interesting Transformations of Functions



Classwork 

Exploratory Challenge 1

Let  and , where  can be any real number.  

Write the formula for  in terms of  (i.e., without using  notation).	





Complete the table of values for these functions.	



















































Graph both equations:   and .



 





















How does the graph of  relate to the graph of ?  











How are the values of  related to the values of ?  







Exploratory Challenge 2

Let  and , where  can be any real number.  

Rewrite the formula for  in terms of  (i.e., without using  notation).	







Complete the table of values for these functions.  






















































Graph both equations:   and .





























How does the graph of  relate to the graph of ?  









How are the values of  related to the values of ?



Exercise 

Complete the table of values for the given functions. 
























































Label each of the graphs with the appropriate functions from the table.













































Describe the transformation that takes the graph of  to the graph of .











Consider  and.  What does negating the input do to the graph of ?











Write the formula of an exponential function whose graph would be a horizontal stretch relative to the 
graph of . 










Exploratory Challenge 3

Look at the graph of  for the function  in Exploratory Challenge 1 again.  Would we see a difference in the graph of   if  were used as the scale factor instead of ?  If so, describe the difference.  If not, explain why not. 















A reflection across the -axis takes the graph of  for the function  back to itself.  Such a transformation is called a reflection symmetry.  What is the equation for the graph of the reflection symmetry of the graph of ?















Deriving the answer to the following question is fairly sophisticated; do this only if you have time.  In Lessons 17 and 18, we used the function  to examine the graphical effects of transformations of a function.  In this lesson, we use the function  to examine the graphical effects of transformations of a function.  Based on the observations you made while graphing, why would using be a better option than using the function ?
