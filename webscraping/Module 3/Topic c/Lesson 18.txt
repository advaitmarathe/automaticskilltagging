Exercises 

Karla and Isamar are disagreeing over which way the graph of the function  is translated relative to the graph of .  Karla believes the graph of  is “to the right” of the graph of  Isamar believes the graph is “to the left.”  Who is correct?  Use the coordinates of the vertex of  and  to support your explanation. 















Let , where  can be any real number.  Write a formula for the function whose graph is the transformation of the graph of  given by the instructions below.

Problem Set 



Working with quadratic functions:

The vertex of the quadratic function  is at , which is the minimum for the graph of   Based on your work in this lesson, to where do you predict the vertex will be translated for the graphs of                 and ?

Complete the table of values, and then graph all three functions.



































































Let  for every real number .  The graph of the equation  is provided on the Cartesian plane below.  Transformations of the graph of  are described below.  After each description, write the equation for the transformed graph.  Then, sketch the graph of the equation you write for part (d).

Translate the graph left  units and down  units.  

Reflect the resulting graph from part (a) across the -axis. 

Scale the resulting graph from part (b) vertically by a scale factor of . 

Translate the resulting graph from part (c) right  units and up  units.  Graph the resulting equation.  



















Let  for all real numbers .  Write the formula for the function represented by the described transformation of the graph of .

First, a vertical stretch with scale factor  is performed, then a translation right  units, and finally a translation down  unit.	

First, a vertical stretch with scale factor  is performed, then a reflection over the -axis, then a translation left  units, and finally a translation up  units.

First, a reflection across the -axis is performed, then a translation left 4 units, then a translation up units, and finally a vertical stretch with scale factor .

Compare your answers to parts (b) and (c).  Why are they different?



Write the formula for the function depicted by each graph.
