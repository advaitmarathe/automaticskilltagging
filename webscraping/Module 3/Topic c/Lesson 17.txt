Exercise

Make up your own function  by drawing the graph of it on the Cartesian plane below.  Label it as the graph of the equation .  If  and  for every real number , graph the equations  and  on the same Cartesian plane.























Problem Set 



Let  for every real number .  The graph of  is shown below.  Describe how the graph for each function below is a transformation of the graph of .  Then, use this same set of axes to graph each function for Problems 1–5.  Be sure to label each function on your graph (by , , etc.).

















 

























































Let  and  for every real number .  The graph of  is shown below.  
Complete the table below to generate output values for the function , and then graph the equation  on the same set of axes as the graph of .




















































Let  for every real number .  Let  and  be functions found by transforming the graph of .  
Use the graphs of ,, and  below to write the functions  and  in terms of the function .  (Hint:  What is the ?)
