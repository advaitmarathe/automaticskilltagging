Lesson 16:  Graphs Can Solve Equations Too



Classwork 

Opening Exercise

Solve for  in the following equation:  .









Now, let  and .  
When does ?

Graph  and  on the same set of axes.



When does ?  What is the visual significance of the points where ?















Is each intersection point  an element of the graph  and an element of the graph of ?  In other words, do the functions  and  really have the same value when ?  What about when ? 

















Example 1

Solve this equation by graphing two functions on the same Cartesian plane:  .  

Let ,and let ,where  can be any real number.

We are looking for values of  at which the functions  and  have the same output value.

Therefore, we set  and , so we can plot the graphs on the same coordinate plane: 





























From the graph, we see that the two intersection points are _____________ and _____________. 





The fact that the graphs of the functions meet at these two points means that when  is _______, both  and  are _______, or when  is _______, both  and  are  _______.





Thus, the expressions  and  are equal when  _______ or when _______.



Therefore, the solution set to the original equation is ___________.



Example 2

Solve this equation graphically:  .

Write the two functions represented by each side of the equation.







Graph the functions in an appropriate viewing window.





















Determine the intersection points of the two functions.







Verify that the -coordinates of the intersection points are solutions to the equation.

















Exercises 1–5

Use the graphs to approximate the solution(s) to the equation .













Let ,and let .  Find all solutions to the equation .  Verify any exact solutions that you determine using the definitions of f and g.  Explain how you arrived at your solutions.















The graphs of , a function that involves taking an absolute value, and , a linear function, are shown to the right.  Both functions are defined over all real values for . Tami concluded that the equation  has no solution. 

Do you agree or disagree?  Explain your reasoning.



























The graphs of  (a function that involves taking the absolute value) and  (an exponential function) are shown below.  Sharon said the solution set to the equation ) is exactly .

Do you agree or disagree with Sharon?  Explain your reasoning.

 












Problem Set

7.	The graph shows Glenn’s distance from home as he rode his bicycle to school, which is just down his street.  His next-door neighbor Pablo, who lives  closer to the school, leaves his house at the same time as Glenn.  He walks at a constant velocity, and they both arrive at school at the same time.

Graph a linear function that represents Pablo’s distance from Glenn’s home as a function of time.

Estimate when the two boys pass each other.

Write piecewise linear functions to represent each boy’s distance, and use them to verify your answer to part (b).
