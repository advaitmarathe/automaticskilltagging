Reexamine your work on Exploratory Challenge 2 and Exercises 3 and 4 from this lesson.  Parts (b) and (c) of Exploratory Challenge 2 asked how the equations  and  could be graphed with the help of the strategic points found in part (a).  In this problem, we investigate whether it is possible to determine the graphs of

Let .  Use the graph you sketched in Exploratory Challenge 2, part (c) of  to write the formula for the function  as a piecewise linear function.

Compare the piecewise linear functions  and  to the piecewise linear function .  Did the expressions defining each piece change?  If so, how?  Did the domains of each piece change?  If so how?
