Lesson 19:  Translating Graphs of Functions



Classwork

Opening Exercise

Graph each set of three functions in the same coordinate plane (on your graphing calculator or a piece of graph paper). Then, explain what similarities and differences you see among the graphs.

	

	

	

	

	

	 

	

	

	

	









































Example

For each graph, answer the following:

What is the parent function?	

How does the translated graph relate to the graph of the parent function?

Write the formula for the function depicted by the translated graph.

























































Exercises

For each of the following graphs, use the formula for the parent function  to write the formula of the translated function.















































































Below is a graph of a piecewise function  whose domain is .  Sketch the graphs of the given functions on the same coordinate plane.  Label your graphs correctly. 

 		

Match the correct equation and description of the function with the given graphs.

Problem Set 



Graph the functions in the same coordinate plane.  Do not use a graphing calculator.  





























Write a function that translates the graph of the parent function  down  units and right  units.



How would the graph of  be affected if the function were transformed to ?



Below is a graph of a piecewise function  whose domain is the interval  .  Sketch the graph of the given functions below.  Label your graphs correctly.





          [Be careful; this one might be a challenge.]

Study the graphs below.  Identify the parent function and the transformations of that function depicted by the second graph.  Then, write the formula for the transformed function.
