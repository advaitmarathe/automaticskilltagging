Lesson 8:  Exploring the Symmetry in Graphs of Quadratic Functions



Classwork 

Graph Vocabulary

Axis of symmetry:  Given a quadratic function in standard form, , the vertical line given by the graph of the equation  is called the axis of symmetry of the graph of the quadratic function.

Vertex:  The point where the graph of a quadratic function and its axis of symmetry intersect is called the vertex.

End behavior of a graph:  Given a quadratic function in the form  (or ), the quadratic function is said to open up if  and open down if .  

If , then  has a minimum at the -coordinate of the vertex; that is,  is decreasing for -values less than 
(or to the left of) the vertex, and  is increasing for -values greater than (or to the right of) the vertex.  

If , then  has a maximum at the -coordinate of the vertex; that is,  is increasing for -values less than 
(or to the left of) the vertex, and  is decreasing for -values greater than (or to the right of) the vertex.

Exploratory Challenge 1

Below are some examples of curves found in architecture around the world.  Some of these might be represented by graphs of quadratic functions.  What are the key features these curves have in common with a graph of a quadratic function? 



		

			St. Louis Arch	Bellos Falls Arch Bridge

		

			Arch of Constantine	Roman Aqueduct



The photographs of architectural features above MIGHT be closely represented by graphs of quadratic functions.  Answer the following questions based on the pictures.

	How would you describe the overall shape of a graph of a quadratic function?







	What is similar or different about the overall shape of the above curves? 







IMPORTANT:  Many of the photographs in this activity cannot actually be modeled with a quadratic function but rather are catenary curves.  These are “quadratic-like” and can be used for our exploration purposes as they display many of the same features, including the symmetry we are exploring in this lesson.

Understanding the symmetry of quadratic functions and their graphs (Look at the tables and row 5 in the chart.)

What patterns do you see in the tables of values you made next to Graph A and Graph B?











Finding the vertex and axis of symmetry (Look at rows 1 and 2 of the chart.)

How can we know the -coordinate of the vertex by looking at the -coordinates of the zeros (or any pair of symmetric points)?













Understanding end behavior (Look at rows 3 and 4 of the chart.)

What happens to the -values of the functions as the -values increase to very large numbers?  What about as the -values decrease to very small numbers (in the negative direction)?













How can we know whether a graph of a quadratic function opens up or down? 













Identifying intervals on which the function is increasing or decreasing (Look at row 6 in the chart.)

Is it possible to determine the exact intervals that a quadratic function is increasing or decreasing just by looking at a graph of the function?















Computing average rate of change on an interval (Look at row 7 in the chart.)

Explain why the average rate of change over the interval  for Graph A was zero.















How are finding the slope of a line and finding the average rate of change on an interval of a quadratic function similar?  How are they different?















Finding a unique quadratic function:

Can you graph a quadratic function if you don’t know the vertex?  Can you graph a quadratic function if you only know the -intercepts?













Remember that we need to know at least two points to define a unique line.  Can you identify a unique quadratic function with just two points?  Explain. 

















What is the minimum number of points needed to identify a unique quadratic function?  Explain why.

Verify that the average rate of change for the interval , or , is .  Show your steps.













Based on your answer to row 6 in the table for Exploratory Challenge 2, what interval would have an average rate of change of ?  Explain.
















Lesson Summary

Quadratic functions create a symmetrical curve with its highest (maximum) or lowest (minimum) point corresponding to its vertex and an axis of symmetry passing through the vertex when graphed.  The -coordinate of the vertex is the average of the -coordinates of the zeros or any two symmetric points on the graph.    

When the leading coefficient is a negative number, the graph opens down, and its end behavior is that both ends move towards negative infinity.  If the leading coefficient is positive, the graph opens up, and both ends move towards positive infinity.
