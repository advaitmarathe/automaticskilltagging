Consider the quadratic function .

Use the quadratic formula to find the -intercepts of the graph of the function.









Use the -intercepts to write the quadratic function in factored form.









Show that the function from part (b) written in factored form is equivalent to the original function. 











Extension:  Consider the quadratic equation .

Write the equation in factored form, , where  and  are the solutions to the equation.









Show that the equation from part (a) is equivalent to the original equation.














Lesson Summary

You can use the sign of the discriminant, , to determine the number of real solutions to a quadratic equation in the form , where .  If the equation has a positive discriminant, there are two real solutions.  A negative discriminant yields no real solutions, and a discriminant equal to zero yields only one real solution.
