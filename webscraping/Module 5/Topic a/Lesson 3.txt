Lesson 3:  Analyzing a Verbal Description



Classwork 

Read the example problems below and discuss a problem-solving strategy with a partner or small group.



Example 1

Gregory plans to purchase a video game player.  He has  in his savings account and plans to save  per week from his allowance until he has enough money to buy the player.  He needs to figure out how long it will take.  What type of function should he use to model this problem?  Justify your answer mathematically.











Example 2

One of the highlights in a car show event is a car driving up a ramp and flying over approximately five cars placed end-to-end.  The ramp is  at its highest point, and there is an upward speed of  before it leaves the top of the ramp.  What type of function can best model the height, , in feet, of the car  seconds after leaving the end of the ramp?  Justify your answer mathematically.











Example 3

Margie got  from her grandmother to start her college fund.  She is opening a new savings account and finds out that her bank offers a  annual interest rate, compounded monthly.  What type of function would best represent the amount of money in Margie’s account?  Justify your answer mathematically.







Exercises

City workers recorded the number of squirrels in a park over a period of time.  At the first count, there were  pairs of male and female squirrels ( squirrels total).  After  months, the city workers recorded a total of  squirrels, and after a year, there were . 

What type of function can best model the population of squirrels recorded over a period of time, assuming the same growth rate and that no squirrel dies?













Write a function that represents the population of squirrels recorded over  number of years.  Explain how you determined your function.















A rectangular photograph measuring by  is surrounded by a frame with a uniform width, . 

What type of function can best represent the area of the picture and the frame in terms of (the unknown frame’s width)?  Explain mathematically how you know.













Write an equation in standard form representing the area of the picture and the frame.  Explain how you arrive at your equation.













A ball is tossed up in the air at an initial rate of  from  off the ground. 

What type of function models the height (, in feet) of the ball after  seconds?













Explain what is happening to the height of the ball as it travels over a period of time (in  seconds).













What function models the height,  (in feet), of the ball over a period of time (in  seconds)?













A population of insects is known to triple in size every month.  At the beginning of a scientific research project, there were insects. 

What type of function models the population of the insects after  years?













Write a function that models the population growth of the insects after  years.












Lesson Summary

The following methods can be used to recognize a function type from a word problem:

If a problem requires repeated addition or subtraction of a constant value, then it is represented by a linear function.

If a problem involves free-falling motion of an object or an area, then it is represented by a quadratic function.

If a problem is about population growth or compound interest, then it is represented by an exponential function.

Problem Set 



The costs to purchase school spirit posters are as follows:  two posters for , four posters for , six posters for , eight posters for , and so on.

What type of function would best represent the cost of the total number of posters purchased?

What function represents the cost of the total number of posters purchased?  How did you know?  Justify your reasoning.

If you have  to spend, write an inequality to find the maximum number of posters you could buy.



NYC Sports Gym had members in 2011.  Based on statistics, the total number of memberships increases by  annually. 

What type of function models the total number of memberships in this situation?

If the trend continues, what function represents the total number of memberships in  years?  How did you know?  Justify your reasoning.



Derek throws a baseball upward from an initial height of.  The baseball hits the ground after  seconds.  

What was the initial velocity of the baseball?

What is the function that models the height,  (in feet), of the baseball over a period of time  (in seconds)?  

At what time did the baseball reach its maximum height?  What was the maximum height of the baseball?
