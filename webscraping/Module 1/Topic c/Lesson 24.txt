Opening Exercise

In Lewis Carroll’s Through the Looking Glass, Tweedledum says, “The sum of your weight and twice mine is  pounds.”  Tweedledee replies, “The sum of your weight and twice mine is  pounds.”  Find both of their weights.























Example

Lulu tells her little brother, Jack, that she is holding  coins, all of which are either dimes or quarters.  They have a value of .  She says she will give him the coins if he can tell her how many of each she is holding.  Solve this problem for Jack.  





















Exploratory Challenge

At a state fair, there is a game where you throw a ball at a pyramid of cans.  If you knock over all of the cans, you win a prize.  The cost is  throws for , but if have you an armband, you get  throws for .  The armband costs .

Write two cost equations for the game in terms of the number of throws purchased, one without an armband and one with.

























Graph the two cost equations on the same graph.  Be sure to label the axes and show an appropriate scale.





Does it make sense to buy the armband?




























A clothing manufacturer has  of cotton to make shirts and pajamas.  A shirt requires  of fabric, and a pair of pajamas requires  of fabric.  It takes  to make a shirt and  to make the pajamas, and there are  available to make the clothing.

What are the variables?







What are the constraints?







Write inequalities for the constraints. 











Graph the inequalities and shade the solution set.





What does the shaded region represent?







Suppose the manufacturer makes a profit of  on shirts and  on pajamas.  How would it decide how many of each to make?







How many of each should the manufacturer make, assuming it will sell all the shirts and pajamas it makes?











Problem Set 



Find two numbers such that the sum of the first and three times the second is  and the sum of second and two times the first is .



A chemist has two solutions:  a  methane solution and an  methane solution.  He wants  of a  methane solution.  How many  of each solution does he need to mix?



Pam has two part time jobs.  At one job, she works as a cashier and makes  per hour.  At the second job, she works as a tutor and makes  per hour.  One week she worked  hours and made .  How many hours did she spend at each job?



A store sells Brazilian coffee for  per  and Columbian coffee for  per .  If the store decides to make a 
- blend of the two and sell it for  per , how much of each type of coffee should be used?



A potter is making cups and plates.  It takes her  to make a cup and  to make a plate.  Each cup uses  of clay, and each plate uses . of clay.  She has  available to make the cups and plates and has 
 of clay.

What are the variables?

Write inequalities for the constraints.

Graph and shade the solution set.

If she makes a profit of  on each cup and  on each plate, how many of each should she make in order to maximize her profit?

What is her maximum profit?
