Lesson 19:  Rearranging Formulas



Classwork

Exercises 1–3

Solve each equation for .  For part (c), remember a variable symbol, like , , and , represents a number.

























Compare your work in parts (a) through (c) above.  Did you have to do anything differently to solve for  in part (c)?

















Solve the equation  for .  The variable symbols , , and , represent numbers.



































Example 1:  Rearranging Familiar Formulas

The area  of a rectangle is .  The formula for area is .

If the width  is , what is the length ?





If the width  is , what is the length ?





Rearrange the area formula to solve for .  











Verify that the area formula, solved for , will give the same results for  as having solved for  in the original area formula.  









Exercises 4–5

Solve each problem two ways.  First, substitute the given values, and solve for the given variable.  Then, solve for the given variable, and substitute the given values.

The perimeter formula for a rectangle is , where  represents the perimeter,  represents the length, and  represents the width.  Calculate  when  and .











The area formula for a triangle is , where  represents the area,  represents the length of the base, and  represents the height.  Calculate  when  and .







Rearrange each formula to solve for the specified variable.  Assume no variable is equal to .   

Given ,

Solve for .

















Solve for .

















Given ,

Solve for .

















Solve for .













Example 2:  Comparing Equations with One Variable to Those with More Than One Variable



Equation Containing More Than One Variable

Solve for .


















Lesson Summary

The properties and reasoning used to solve equations apply regardless of how many variables appear in an equation or formula.  Rearranging formulas to solve for a specific variable can be useful when solving applied problems.
