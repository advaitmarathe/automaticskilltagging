Lesson 21:  Solution Sets to Inequalities with Two Variables



Classwork

Exercises 1–2



Circle each ordered pair  that is a solution to the equation . 



				





				







Plot each solution as a point  in the coordinate plane. 











How would you describe the location of the solutions in the coordinate plane?
















Discover as many additional solutions to the inequality  as possible.  Organize solutions by plotting each solution as a point  in the coordinate plane.  Be prepared to share the strategies used to find the solutions.

















Graph the line .  What do we notice about the solutions to the inequality  and the graph of the line ? 















Solve the inequality for . 











Complete the following sentence:  

If an ordered pair is a solution to , then it will be located					

the line .  



Explain how you arrived at your conclusion.













Example

Exercises 3–5

Using a separate sheet of graph paper, plot the solution sets to the following equations and inequalities:









































Which of the inequalities in this exercise are linear inequalities?









A half-plane is the graph of a solution set in the Cartesian coordinate plane of an inequality in two real-number variables that is linear and strict.

A half-plane is the graph of a solution set in the Cartesian coordinate plane of an inequality in two real-number variables that is linear and strict.



Describe in words the half-plane that is the solution to each inequality.

 





































Graph the solution set to , reading it as an inequality in one variable, and describe the solution set in words.  Then graph the solution set to  again, this time reading it as an inequality in two variables, and describe the solution set in words.  






























Lesson Summary

An ordered pair is a solution to a two-variable inequality if, when each number is substituted into its corresponding variable, it makes the inequality a true number sentence.   

Each ordered pair of numbers in the solution set of the inequality corresponds to a point on the coordinate plane.  The set of all such points in the coordinate plane is called the graph of the inequality.  

The graph of a linear inequality in the coordinate plane is called a half-plane.

Problem Set 



Match each inequality with its graph.  Explain your reasoning. 


















Graph the solution set in the coordinate plane.  Support your answer by selecting two ordered pairs in the solution set and verifying that they make the inequality true.

























Marti sells tacos and burritos from a food truck at the farmers market.  She sells burritos for  each and tacos for  each.  She hopes to earn at least  at the farmers market this Saturday.

Identify three combinations of tacos and burritos that will earn Marti more than .

Identify three combinations of tacos and burritos that will earn Marti exactly .

Identify three combinations of tacos and burritos that will not earn Marti at least .

Graph your answers to parts (a)–(c) in the coordinate plane, and then shade a half-plane that contains all possible solutions to this problem.

Create a linear inequality that represents the solution to this problem.  Let  equal the number of burritos that Marti sells, and let  equal the number of tacos that Marti sells. 

Is the point  a solution to the inequality you created in part (e)?  Explain your reasoning.
