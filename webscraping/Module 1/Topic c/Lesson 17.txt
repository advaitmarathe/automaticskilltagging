Lesson 17:  Equations Involving Factored Expressions



Classwork 

Exercise 1

Solve each equation for .

















Demanding Dwight insists that you give him two solutions to the following equation:



Can you provide him with two solutions?









Demanding Dwight now wants FIVE solutions to the following equation:



Can you provide him with five solutions?











Do you think there might be a sixth solution?









Consider the equation .

Rewrite the equation as a compound statement.

		







Find the two solutions to the equation.

	







Example 1

Solve , for .











Example 2

Solve   for .













Exercises 2–7 































Example 3

Consider the equation Lulu chooses to multiply through by  and gets the 
answer .  But Poindexter points out that  is also an answer, which Lulu missed.

What’s the problem with Lulu’s approach?















Use factoring to solve the original equation for .
