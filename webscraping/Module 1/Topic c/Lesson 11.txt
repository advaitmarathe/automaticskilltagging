Lesson 11:  Solution Sets for Equations and Inequalities



Classwork

Example 1

Consider the equation, , where  represents a real number.  

Are the expressions  and  algebraically equivalent?  











The following table shows how we might “sift” through various values to assign to the variable symbol  in the hunt for values that would make the equation true.

The solution set of an equation written with only one variable is the set of all values one can assign to that variable to make the equation a true statement.  Any one of those values is said to be a solution to the equation. 


To solve an equation means to find the solution set for that equation.

Example 3

Solve for :  .  
















One can describe a solution set in any of the following ways:

IN WORDS:   has solutions  and .  ( is true when  or .)


IN SET NOTATION:  The solution set of  is . 


IN A GRAPHICAL REPRESENTATION ON A NUMBER LINE:  The solution set of  is



In this graphical representation, a solid dot is used to indicate a point on the number line that is to be included in the solution set.  (WARNING: The dot one physically draws is larger than the point it represents.  One hopes that it is clear from the context of the diagram which point each dot refers to.)


How set notation works.  

The curly brackets { } indicate we are denoting a set.  A set is essentially a collection of things (e.g., letters, numbers, cars, people).  In this case, the things are numbers. 

From this example, the numbers  and  are called elements of the set.  No other elements belong in this particular set because no other numbers make the equation  true.  

When elements are listed, they are listed in increasing order.  

Sometimes, a set is empty; it has no elements.  In which case, the set looks like {  }.  We often denote this with the symbol, .  We refer to this as the empty set or the null set.





Exercise 1

Solve for :  .  Present the solution set in words, in set notation, and graphically.





















Exercise 2

Exercise 4

Solve for :  .  Describe carefully the reasoning that justifies your solution.  Describe the solution set in words, in set notation, and graphically. 

















An identity is an equation that is always true.



An identity is an equation that is always true.



Exercise 5

Identify the properties of arithmetic that justify why each of the following equations has a solution set of all real numbers.































Exercise 6

Create an expression for the right side of each equation such that the solution set for the equation will be all real numbers.  (There is more than one possibility for each expression.  Feel free to write several answers for each one.)

Exercise 7

Solve for :  .  Describe the solution set using a number line.  

















What is the solution set to the statement:  “Sticks of lengths  yards,  yards, and  yards make an isosceles triangle”?  Describe the solution set in words and on a number line.






Lesson Summary

The solution set of an equation written with only one variable symbol is the set of all values one can assign to that variable to make the equation a true number sentence.  Any one of those values is said to be a solution to the equation. 

To solve an equation means to find the solution set for that equation.  


One can describe a solution set in any of the following ways:

IN WORDS:   has solutions  and .  ( is true when  or .)

IN SET NOTATION:  The solution set of  is . 


It is awkward to express the set of infinitely many numbers in set notation.  In these cases we can use the 
notation .  For example  reads, “ is a real number where  is greater than zero.”  The symbol ℝ can be used to indicate all real numbers.


IN A GRAPHICAL REPRESENTAION ON A NUMBER LINE:  The solution set of  is as follows: 



In this graphical representation, a solid dot is used to indicate a point on the number line that is to be included in the solution set.  (WARNING:  The dot one physically draws is larger than the point it represents!  One hopes that it 
is clear from the context of the diagram which point each dot refers to.)

For Problems 19–24, answer the following:  Are the two expressions algebraically equivalent?  If so, state the property (or properties) displayed.  If not, state why (the solution set may suffice as a reason) and change the equation, ever so slightly (e.g., touch it up) to create an equation whose solution set is all real numbers.
